This is a customized MSX2 logo made in one piece. You can extrude and scale the SVG with your favourite program to your pleasure, or do it in your slicer program, because the print on the photograph is scaled 120% in X and Y (but not Z), with respect to the .STL file. (I found it too small before printing it)

I include the STL, the SVG and the Freecad project files.
