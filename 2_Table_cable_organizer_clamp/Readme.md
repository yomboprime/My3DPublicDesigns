This is a simple cable organizer that fits in a table (preferably in the rear, next to the wall).

In the Freecad file (.fcstd), the table thickness is adjustable (change the TABLE_THICKNESS parameter in the sketch)

It is designed also to hold a power strip. You can print as many organizers as you like to hold all your stuff ;-)

Designed in Freecad.
