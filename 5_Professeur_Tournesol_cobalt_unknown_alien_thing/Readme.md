This is a thing Professeur Tournesol found in his pocket at the end of the 'Flight 714 to Sydney' Tintin comic. He described it as a metal wire ended in an hemispherical head, and said the lab analysis shown it was made of pure state cobalt, alloyed with a ferronickel composite. "As there is no pure cobalt in the Earth, it must have an extraterrestrial origin", he concludes, live on TV.

As the comic images show the thing in the black and white TV set, I don't know the actual color. I was going to paint it in chrome color, but my brother suggested to paint in bronze. I think pure cobalt is like silver; paint it to your liking.

The STL file is half of the part, you must print two copies, one mirrored respect to the other. Then glue it, and paint it if you like.

I should have painted the oranges in blue, don't you think?
