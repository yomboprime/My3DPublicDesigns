Pen plotter addon for 3D printer. Made in Freecad. Included sources, published here.

It is easily mounted on the side of the 40 mm layer fan and can be left permanently installed.

You will need some smooth 4mm in diameter shaft cut to length (two pieces). I used aluminum but other materials such as PVC, steel, carbon fiber, etc. can be used. The shafts can be pressed in, no glue needed.

It uses a standard SG90 miniservo. You can find wether your printer has free pins and activate one for the servo in Marlin.

You also will need a short 2 mm in diameter screw for the connecting rod, and standard screws to mount the servo, and its arm to the connecting rod.

The pen holder is a small piece that you can easily interchange for different pen sizes (I have to design yet different pen holders, for example for a fountain pen). It can be removed or left mounted while 3D printing. It has a captive screw to keep the pen in place, to which you can make a groove so it is at the same height in every plot. Probably you'll need to file the shaft holes in this part a bit until it runs smoothly.

New: Added pen holder for 12 mm pen.

-- PRINT SETTINGS --

Print all parts in the orientation they are when you load them.

Standard 0.150 mm layer height is OK for all parts (0.2 mm for the first layer)

Part 1 - The support base: This part can be printed with standard 20% infill. No supports, 7 layers top, 7 layers bottom, 3 vertical shells. Print a skirt if you want, but no brim is needed.

Part 2 - The pen holder: 20% infill, No supports, 3 bottom and top layers, 2 vertical shells, bridges activated, brim of 12 mm at least (otherwise it can pop out of the build plate)

Part 3 - The servo arm (connecting rod): It is important to print it with 100% infill. It DOES require supports. No brim.
