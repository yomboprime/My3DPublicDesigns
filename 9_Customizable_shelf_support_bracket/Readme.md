This is a shelf support bracket, it can be attached to a round table leg and will support a shelf. Four sets of the two different pieces are needed to support a shelf.

It is customizable (made in Freecad, an open source 3D software) You can edit the diameter and height in the spreadsheet you will find in the included Freecad file.

None of the two pieces need supports.
